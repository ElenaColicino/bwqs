# Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum

This package provides the code for running BWQS regressions. 

In order to run the model, install Rtools (see the version of Rtools for your specific R version at this link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 
on your machine and run the following command on your console: 
```
devtools::install_github("ElenaColicino/bwqs")
library(BWQS)
```

For additional information on the BWQS regression please read this paper:

Update: the function `bwqs_r` for the *Hierarchical Bayesian Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum* has been added to the package.
