# Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum

This package provides the code for running BWQS regressions. The code was built with STAN.

In order to run the model install Rtools (see the version of Rtools for your specific R version at this link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 
on your machine and run the following command on your console: 
```
devtools::install_github("ElenaColicino/bwqs")
library(BWQS)
```
